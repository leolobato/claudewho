# claudewho

Manage multiple Claude Code account configurations easily. Switch between work
and personal accounts, or maintain separate configurations for different
projects.

## Installation

### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew install frisble/tap/claudewho
```

Or:

```bash
brew tap frisble/tap
brew install claudewho
```

### Manual

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frisble/claudewho.git
cd claudewho
chmod +x bin/claudewho
sudo ln -s "$(pwd)/bin/claudewho" /usr/local/bin/claudewho
```

## Usage

### Create accounts

```bash
claudewho add work
claudewho add personal
claudewho add client-project
```

### Migrate settings from ~/.claude

Copy your existing Claude Code configuration to a new account:

```bash
# During account creation
claudewho add work --migrate

# Or after creating an account
claudewho migrate work
```

This copies your settings, skills, plugins, and project history. An interactive
selector lets you choose which project groups to include. Running it again on
the same account is safe — existing items are skipped.

Plugin metadata stores absolute paths (e.g. `~/.claude/plugins/...`), so
migration rewrites those to point at the account directory. Without this,
plugin installs fail with "Source path does not exist". Re-running `migrate`
also repairs an account whose plugin paths were left pointing at `~/.claude`.

### List accounts

```bash
claudewho list
```

Output:

```
Configured Claude accounts:

  work                 ~/.claudewho-work              (authenticated)
  personal             ~/.claudewho-personal          (not authenticated)
  client-project       ~/.claudewho-client-project    (authenticated)

Use claudewho-<name> or claudewho use <name> to launch.
```

### Launch Claude with an account

```bash
# Using the wrapper command (recommended)
claudewho-work
claudewho-personal

# Or using the command
claudewho use work
```

### Remove an account

```bash
claudewho remove personal
```

This will prompt for confirmation before deleting the account directory.

## Commands

| Command          | Description                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `list`           | List all configured accounts                 |
| `add <name>`     | Create a new account configuration           |
| `migrate <name>` | Migrate settings and projects from ~/.claude |
| `remove <name>`  | Remove an account (with confirmation)        |
| `use <name>`     | Switch to the specified account              |
| `ide-setup`      | Configure IDE integration (VSCode)           |
| `shell-init`     | Print shell aliases for sourcing             |
| `version`        | Show version information                     |
| `help`           | Show help message                            |

## IDE Integration (VSCode)

The Claude Code IDE extensions bundle their own CLI and don't respect
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` by default. claudewho provides wrapper scripts that work
with the extension's `claudeProcessWrapper` setting.

### Setup

```bash
claudewho ide-setup
```

This creates the necessary wrapper scripts and prints configuration
instructions.

### Option 1: Follow current account

All IDE windows share whichever account is active via `claudewho use <name>`.

Add to your VSCode settings.json (`Cmd+Shift+P` > "Open Settings (JSON)"):

```json
"claudeCode.claudeProcessWrapper": "~/.local/bin/claudewho-ide"
```

### Option 2: Per-workspace account (parallel)

Different workspaces can use different accounts simultaneously.

Add to your workspace's `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
"claude-code.claudeProcessWrapper": "~/.local/bin/claudewho-ide-work"
```

To see all available per-account wrappers:

```bash
claudewho ide-setup
```

Or get the config for a specific account:

```bash
claudewho ide-setup --account work
```

## How it works

- Each account is stored in `~/.claudewho-<name>/`
- Account names are tracked in `~/.claudewho.conf`
- Wrapper scripts like `claudewho-work` are created in `~/.local/bin/` and set
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` before launching Claude
- Your original `~/.claude` directory is never modified

## Requirements

- Claude Code CLI installed (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- Bash 4.0+ or Zsh
- macOS or Linux

## Notes

- Each account requires a separate Anthropic account (different email)
- Each account has its own usage limits
- Check [Anthropic's terms of service](https://www.anthropic.com/terms) to
  ensure compliance
